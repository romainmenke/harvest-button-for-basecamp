Fully isolate the harvest button inside an iframe.

The associated userscript is intended for Basecamp, but the iframe could be used anywhere.

This fixes issues with conflicting global JavaScript between Basecamp and Harvest.

_I strongly dislike both Basecamp and Harvest, but unfortunately I need to use them._
